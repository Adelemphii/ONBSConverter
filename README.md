# ONBS-Reader-FRP
WIP Reader for Note Block Studio, formatted to FRP Musicsheets

## How-To-Use:
Make sure your NBS file doesn't contain more than 1 note on the same tick, download the Dist file and open the "ONBS_Reader.exe" executable. I don't think you need python installed to use it? If you do, I'll work on a workaround.
