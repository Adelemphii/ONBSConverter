# ONBSConverter
Converter for Note Block Studio, formatted to Musicsheets in FRP (& LoTC soon?)

# Being Rewritten

## How-To-Use:
Make sure your NBS file doesn't contain more than 1 note on the same tick, download the Dist file and open the "ONBS_Reader.exe" executable. I don't think you need python installed to use it? If you do, I'll work on a workaround.
